Present in more than 10 countries and multiple datacentres, Docplanner's mission is to connect patients with doctors to simplify and humanize the medical industry.

I'm part of the patient experience and booking flow team implementing new business requirements, features, upgrades and squashing bugs.

The stack consists of Symfony, Vue and MariaDB as the main pillars, with Elasticsearch, MongoDB and RabbitMQ acting as supporting pillars to increase performance and share data between the projects owned by other teams.
