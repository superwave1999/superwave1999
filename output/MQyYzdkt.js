Mr. Alfred is a B2B SaaS based in Dubai that helps manage holiday rentals.

It syncs information with the top OTA's such as Booking, Expedia and Airbnb and receives reservations from these same channels.

It includes an onboarding assistant developed from scratch by yours truly, and mobile apps for the property owner and cleaning personnel.

I also developed an upload, scan, and validation flow for the guests' IDs.

The product also integrates payment gateways such as PayPal, Stripe and RedSys to simplify guests' payments and taxes.
